## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains solutions to Homework Assignment 2, covering topics related to cloud computing for deep learning, convolution operations, and feature extraction using CNNs. The notebook includes both theoretical explanations and Python implementations using libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

## Requirements
To run this notebook successfully, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV (cv2)

You can install the necessary dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow opencv-python
```

## Contents
The notebook is structured into multiple questions:

### **Question 1: Cloud Computing for Deep Learning (20 points)**
- Definition and comparison of elasticity and scalability in cloud computing.
- A comparison of AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure ML.

### **Question 2: Convolution Operations with Different Parameters (20 points)**
- Implementation of convolution using a 5×5 input matrix and a 3×3 kernel.
- Variations with different stride and padding values using NumPy and TensorFlow.

### **Question 3: CNN Feature Extraction with Filters and Pooling (30 points)**
- **Task 1**: Edge detection using a Sobel filter.
- **Task 2**: Applying max pooling and average pooling operations.

### **Question 4: Deep Learning Frameworks Comparison (30 points)**
- A detailed comparison of TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.
- Implementation of a simple neural network using TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Homework_Assignment_2_700757766.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and display the results.
3. Modify parameters where necessary to experiment with different configurations.

## Notes
- Ensure that TensorFlow is correctly installed to avoid compatibility issues.
- If OpenCV (cv2) is not installed, you may need to install it separately using:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python-headless
  ```
